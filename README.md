# Legend of Zelda Dungeon Tech Demo

This is a simple Tech Demo of the first dungeon in the Legend of Zelda.
I wanted to try and re-create as much as I could using ImpactJS TwoPointFive Plugin. 
The game is available to play on itch.io.

## Installation

Either clone repository or download zip from GitHub. The ImpactJS Engine is open source.
[ImpactJS](https://github.com/phoboslab/Impact)
[TwoPointfive](https://github.com/phoboslab/TwoPointFive)

```bash
git clone git@github.com:JarrodRizor/FPS-Zelda-Dung-1.git
```
