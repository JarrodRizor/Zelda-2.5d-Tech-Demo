# Legend of Zelda Dungeon Tech Demo

![title](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JarrodRizor/Zelda-2.5d-Tech-Demo/master/media/misc/title.png)

This is a simple Tech Demo of the first dungeon in the Legend of Zelda.
I wanted to try and re-create as much as I could using ImpactJS TwoPointFive Plugin. 
The game is available to play on [itch.io](https://jarrodrizor.itch.io/zelda-tech-demo).

## Contributing
While I appriciate any input and I know many developers could write cleaner and better code, I'm shelving this for a bit. If you wish to fork it and do your own thing, I'm 100% supportive and would love to see how you have improved the demo!
